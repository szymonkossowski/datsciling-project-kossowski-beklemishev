## Quantifying scope and disrtribution of Slavic Short Adjectives
### by Nikita L. Beklemishev and Szymon T. Kossowski

This project aims to investigate the use of short forms of adjectives in a typologically representative sample of Slavic languages and to revisit the syntactic and semantic cues that influence the choice of the adjective or participle form in a data-driven way.

## Technical data
The project is in the form of a ready-to-use jupyter notebook. After cloning this repo, please, go to [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qNlxOF3FUx4ZWcku9oFqxy0UKH5TH632/view?usp=sharing) and [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LXOrBB7OnakQtlZFyQB72LcvJtsVkrvL/view?usp=sharing), to download necessary data archives. When you download them, move them to the cloned repository and unzip. They are NECESSARY, but due to the limitations of git, including git lfs, we were not able to include them in the repo.
