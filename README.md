# DATA SCIENCE FOR LINGUISTS WiSe 2024/25 - Final Project
## Quantifying scope and disrtribution of Slavic Short Adjectives
### by Nikita L. Beklemishev and Szymon T. Kossowski

This project aims to investigate the use of short forms of adjectives in a typologically representative sample of Slavic languages and to revisit the syntactic and semantic cues that influence the choice of the adjective or participle form in a data-driven way.

## Technical data
The project is in the form of a ready-to-use jupyter notebook. After cloning this repo, please, go to [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qNlxOF3FUx4ZWcku9oFqxy0UKH5TH632/view?usp=sharing) and [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LXOrBB7OnakQtlZFyQB72LcvJtsVkrvL/view?usp=sharing), to download necessary data archives. When you download them, move them to the cloned repository and unzip. They are NECESSARY, but due to the limitations of git, including git lfs, we were not able to include them in the repo.

The notebook can be run on local desktop, as well as in Google Colab (recommended). In order to run the notebook in Google Colab succesfully, please, after cloning this repo, put the repo directory on your Google Drive.

## About the Project
The project objective was to determine how is the choice of the adjective form in the Slavic languages influenced. We used UD corpora as the source of the data, preprocessed them to create a suitable dataset and carried out the operations on that preprocessed data. UD corpora were chosen because of their detailedness and availability to download them to the local environment. This stands in the opposition to most corpora that are explorable only through special search engines and they are almost impossible to download.

The adjective tokens were filtered out, sorted and given one format.
